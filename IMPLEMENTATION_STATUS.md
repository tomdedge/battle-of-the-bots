## üìä Implementation Progress Summary

- **Completed**: ~35% of core spec features
- **Partially Complete**: ~15% of core spec features  
- **Not Started**: ~50% of core spec features

The current implementation provides a solid foundation with authentication, basic calendar/task integration, AI chat, and simple mindfulness features. The next phase should focus on completing the core focus session management and enhancing the AI-driven personalization to deliver the full AuraFlow vision.

## ü§î Questions for Consideration

1. **Scope Prioritization**: Should we focus on perfecting the core focus session experience before adding social features?

2. **AI Strategy**: Would you prefer to enhance the current LLM integration or implement simpler rule-based personalization first?

3. **Soundscape Approach**: Should we integrate with existing music services or create our own ambient sound library?

4. **Mobile Strategy**: Is the current PWA approach sufficient, or should we consider native mobile apps?

5. **Data Privacy**: How much user behavior data should we collect for personalization while maintaining privacy?

The current implementation shows strong technical foundations but needs focused development on the core user experience to match the ambitious vision outlined in the specification.
