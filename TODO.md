COMPLETED:
‚úÖ Aurora's message text is too light in dark mode - Fixed contrast with better background colors
‚úÖ Move hamburger menu to right side - Repositioned next to dark/light toggle with right-side drawer
‚úÖ Improve calendar spacing - Fixed padding consistency and element spacing
‚úÖ Improve typography - Added Google Fonts (Inter) for modern typography
‚úÖ Modernize meditation UI - Made breathing circle clickable, removed bulky controls, removed cycle counter and descriptive text, made circle responsive and larger
‚úÖ Better font (more distinct) for app title "AuraFlow"
‚úÖ Gentle color gradients - Add gradient (with #fff as secondary color) to message bubbles to make them appear "Shiny"
‚úÖ Add the user Avatar Profile image thing that is next to their messages also by the "Signed in as "
in the sidebar menu
‚úÖ Make the "Menu" text/title visually distinguished from other text in the sidebar
‚úÖ Re assess the AI focus time calendar suggestions - Fixed multiple issues: expanded time window (7 AM - 9 PM), reduced minimum duration (15 min), added multi-day analysis, improved gap detection logic, shows suggestions in week view, respects current time, added better logging and more descriptive titles
‚úÖ Use frontend/public/icon.jpg as favicon - Generated favicon.ico with multiple sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48) and added to HTML
‚úÖ Use frontend/public/icon.jpg as app icons referenced in manifest.json - Generated 192x192 and 512x512 PNG icons, updated manifest
‚úÖ Remove the usage of emojis - Removed all emoji usage from components and tests
‚úÖ Ensure text "Dashed events are focus block..." responds correctly to light/dark mode - Changed to use Mantine's `c="dimmed"` prop for proper theme support
‚úÖ The meditation tab does not support dark mode. The background (including the canvas background (which can probably be transparent)) needs to be like the other tab backgrounds in dark mode. The canvas shape colors should also be adjusted for dark mode to a lighter color for each shape.
‚úÖ Implement Focus Session Management - Created SessionTimer component with start/pause/stop controls, integrated with calendar suggestions, added session completion celebrations, and basic session history tracking
‚úÖ Persist the users active tab across refreshes - Added localStorage persistence for active tab with validation and logout cleanup

TODO:

- Push notifications for all upcoming calendar events (15 min before event)
	- 15 min could be configurable via preferences stored in db
- Button in header to start a focus session. Visible timer in header along side 'stop' button
when session is active. Track session time in database to provide analytics on total time in focus session
per day/week/month and to allow AI to analyze trends to display them on a dashboard and to be better at
suggesting focus times in the future.
- persist the users active tab across refreshes.
- cache suggestions for different views to prevent unnecessary calls to the analyze endpoint.
- button on tasks tab to 'schedule all tasks' and a button for each task to 'schedule task' that will ask Aurora (AI Agent) to find a time in the calendar and schedule the task as an event of the same title. Instruct aurora to default to 30 min duration (suggest other defaults) unless a more appropriate alternative to the default is apparent from the task. Once Aurora has scheduled the task, have her update the task title to include a [Scheduled] tag, then show her response to the user in a modal. The modal should show her Avatar next to a speech bubble with her real response. Construct the prompt to facilitate this desired outcome as best as possible.
